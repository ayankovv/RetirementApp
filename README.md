This calculator helps users estimate how long their retirement savings might last, factoring in initial savings, IRA balances, annual expenses, and applicable interest rates. It is designed to provide a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy by splitting annual expenses between the savings and IRA accounts. The calculator adjusts for inflation annually and considers different state tax regimes for California and Massachusetts. It also incorporates social security benefits if applicable, which are added to the savings after taxing them. By minimizing taxable withdrawals from the IRA and optimizing the use of savings, the calculator aims to extend the lifespan of the retireeâ€™s funds. It offers a detailed annual breakdown of expenses, taxes, and remaining balances to help users plan their retirement effectively. Tax calculations include both state and federal taxes based on the income generated from the IRA and interest earned from savings accounts. The system is structured to help retirees manage their cash flows efficiently, maintaining sufficient funds to cover expenses while minimizing the tax impact.
